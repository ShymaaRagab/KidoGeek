        What is Coding?
        <br>
        The Ultimate Guide for Parents
    </p>
    <p class=" text-body-secondary text">Coding is the method of giving a computer
      instructions to perform a specific task. You may also hear coding
      referred to as software programming or computer programming.</p>
      <p class=" text-body-secondary text">These instructions are communicated using a
        language that computers can understand, like visual
        blocks, JavaScript and Python.</p>
        <p class="text-body-secondary text">Code lays the groundwork for our
          world's technology, from microprocessors in everyday items
          like refrigerators and water heaters to
          sophisticated programs that run our cars and buildings.</p>
          <p class=" text-body-secondary text">Learning to code has become an
            essential element of a child's education and a great way
      for them to express their creativity and imagination.</p>
